# standalone-analyser
This analyser is intended to retrieve historical data with metatrader5 and give a feedback.

Created with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3/library/tkinter.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) and [metatrader5](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/python_metatrader5), altough not beautiful, it is a nice-to-have tool in order to provide quick support for people wanting to quickly find patters in the financial markets. 

Metatrader 5 only works in windows, so linux users will not be able to test it.

The name standalone is because I packed it with pyinstaller to share with some friends. You can easily do the same [ by following the documentation here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).
