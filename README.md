# standalone-analyser
This analyser is intended to retrieve historical data with metatrader5 and give a feedback.

Metatrader 5 only works in windows, so linux users will not be able to test it.

The name standalone is because I packed it with pyinstaller to share with some friends. You can easily do the same [ by following the documentation here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).
